# Waglayla Stratum Adapter

This is a [forked](https://github.com/waglayla/waglayla-stratum-bridge) lightweight daemon that allows mining to a local (or remote) waglayla node using stratum-base miners.

This daemon is confirmed working with the miners below in both dual-mining and waglayla-only modes (for those that support it) and Windows/MacOs/Linux/HiveOs.

## Hive Setup
[detailed instructions here](hive-setup.md) 


# Features:

Shares-based work allocation with miner-like periodic stat output:

Prometheus API:

If the app is run with the `-prom={port}` flag the application will host stats on the port specified by `{port}`, these stats are documented in the file [prom.go](src/waglaylastratum/prom.go). This is intended to be use by prometheus but the stats can be fetched and used independently if desired. `curl http://localhost:2114/metrics | grep py_` will get a listing of current stats. All published stats have a `py_` prefix for ease of use.

```
user:~$ curl http://localhost:2114/metrics | grep py_

# Install

## Docker All-in-one

Note: This does requires that docker is installed.

  

`docker compose -f docker-compose-all.yml up -d` will run the bridge with default settings. This assumes a local waglayla node with default port settings and exposes port 5555 to incoming stratum connections.

  

This also spins up a local prometheus and grafana instance that gather stats and host the metrics dashboard. Once the services are up and running you can view the dashboard using `http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/x7cE7G74k/monitoring`

Default grafana user/pass: admin/admin

Most of the stats on the graph are averaged over an hour time period, so keep in mind that the metrics might be inaccurate for the first hour or so that the bridge is up.


## Docker (non-compose)

Note: This does not require pulling down the repo, it only requires that docker is installed.

`docker run -p 5555:5555 waglayla/waglayla-stratum-bridge:latest --log=false` will run the bridge with default settings. This assumes a local waglayla node with default port settings and exposes port 5555 to incoming stratum connections.


Detailed:

`docker run -p {stratum_port}:5555 waglayla/waglayla-stratum-bridge  --log=false --waglayla={waglayla_address} --stats={false}` will run the bridge targeting a waglayla node at {waglayla_address}. stratum port accepting connections on {stratum_port}, and only logging connection activity, found blocks, and errors

  

## Manual build

Install go 1.18 using whatever package manager is approprate for your system

  

run `cd cmd/waglaylabridge;go build .`

  

Modify the config file in ./cmd/bridge/config.yaml with your setup, the file comments explain the various flags

  

run `./waglaylabridge` in the `cmd/waglaylabridge` directory

  

all-in-one (build + run) `cd cmd/waglaylabridge/;go build .;./waglaylabridge`
